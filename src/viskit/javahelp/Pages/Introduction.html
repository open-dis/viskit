<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Viskit is an open-source application to build Discrete Event Simulation (DES)
    models that autogenerate Java source for simulation using the Simkit library.
</p>

<p>
    The Viskit application enables authors to assemble a collection of event graphs
    that describe the behavior of multiple entities in a simulation environment.
</p>

<p>
    Capabilities include Simkit Event Graphs, Assemblies, simulation replication
    tools, and an Analyst Report generator suitable for thesis and research efforts.
</p>

<p>
    The 2025 software release is a thorough refactoring of the underlying Viskit 
    source code, facilitating ongoing project maintenance and development.
</p>

<p>
    Expected to return in future distributions:  Diskit, which is a Java package of
    Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) utilities and Simkit entities for
    3D movement support.  The <a href="https://github.com/open-dis/opendis7-java">opendis7-java</a>
    library is used for state-distribution capabilities that integrates the
    Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol for networked agent behaviors 
    and Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) simulations.
</p>

<p>
    Software and model development efforts are ongoing.
