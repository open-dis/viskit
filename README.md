## Welcome to Viskit

Viskit is an open-source application to build Discrete Event Simulation (DES)
models that autogenerate Java source for simulation using the Simkit library.

The Viskit application enables authors to assemble a collection of event graphs
that describe the behavior of multiple entities in a simulation environment.

Capabilities include Simkit Event Graphs, Assemblies, Run Simulation replication
tools, and an Analyst Report generator suitable for thesis and research efforts.
Further details are found in the
[overview presentation](documentation/presentations/ViskitOverviewPresentation.pdf).

The 2025 software release is a thorough refactoring of the underlying Viskit 
source code, facilitating ongoing project maintenance and development.

Expected to return in future distributions:  Diskit, which is a Java package of
Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) utilities and Simkit entities for
3D movement support.  The [opendis7-java](https://github.com/open-dis/opendis7-java) library
is used for state-distribution capabilities that integrates the
Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol for networked agent behaviors 
and Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) simulations.

Software and model development efforts are ongoing.

We currently use [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org) to run and develop Viskit.
We are planning on releasing binary executables starting in summer 2025.
