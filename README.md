## Welcome to Viskit

Viskit is an open-source application for defining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models 
that autogenerate Java source using the Simkit library.

The Viskit application allows you to build a collection of event graphs that 
describe the behavior of various entities in a simulation environment. 
Capabilities include Simkit Event Graphs, Assemblies, simulation tools, 
and an Analyst Report generator suitable for thesis and research efforts.

The current release includes a thorough refactoring of the underlying Viskit 
source code, facilitating ongoing maintenance and development.  
Efforts are ongoing.

Expected to return in the distribution in 2025: Diskit, which is a 
java package of Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) utilities and 
corresponding Simkit entities for 3D movement support.  The
[opendis7-java](https://github.com/open-dis/opendis7-java) library
is used as a module in Viskit for developing networked agent behaviors.
