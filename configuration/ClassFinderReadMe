A requirement of Simkit is that if a user requires certain jars from being found 
on the classpath, then they must be listed in a config/ClassFinder.properties 
file in this manner:

log4j-api-2.17.0.jar=skip
...

This is especially true when Simkit searches the entire classpath for external
RandomVariate instances while running on <= JDK8 and a project dependency 
contains a jar entry, i.e. META-INF.versions.9/module-info
