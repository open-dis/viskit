A requirement of Simkit is that if a user wants to prevent certain jars 
from being found on the classpath, then they must be listed to be skipped
in a config/ClassFinder.properties file in this manner:

log4j-api-2.24.3.jar=skip
log4j-core-2.24.3.jar=skip
log4j-layout-template-json-2.24.3.jar=skip
...

This is especially true when Simkit searches the entire classpath for external
RandomVariate instances while running on <= JDK8 and a project dependency 
contains a jar entry, i.e. META-INF.versions.9/module-info
